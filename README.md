# BehaviouralQuestions

1. Tell me about yourself?<br>
In my most recent role I worked as a data analyst with Clarity Insights. I have a background of 3 years in the field of data analytics. I have worked at different stages of the data science pipeline during my career where I identified trends in data, derived insights and turned those into meaningful solutions for business use cases. I pursued my Master’s in Computer Science at Wright State University in Ohio and graduated in Dec 2018. At Clarity Insights, my role was providing Data & Analytics expertise that resulted in real and measurable business outcomes. I was involved in analyzing business and data requirements, create machine learning models designed to answer our client’s biggest data challenges and work with cross functional teams to ensure application quality and scalability.<br>
MunichRe is solving problems that have a real world large scale impact.  As we know data is key component in solving these problems, I can leverage my skills and background in data analytics to help the team at MunichRe develop reinsurance solutions that are both sustainable and needs-based. I will get an opportunity to do meaningful work that can have a positive impact on people's lives and that will be incredibly satisfying for me.<br><br>


2. Why are you leaving your current company / why did you leave your last job?<br>
I left Clarity Insights to move to Canada. My Wife and I had both applied for PR for canada and our applications were accepted. My wife got a job in Canada and so we decided to move here. Therefore, I left my last job.<br><br>

3. What internal factors would drive you to leave a good job? <br>
One of the reasons would be a micro-managing boss. Not that I have ever come accross such a situation, in all my previous roles I have felt empowered to make decisions, propose new ideas, received constructive feedback so that I can improve and encourage to learn new skills and keep upto date with latest technology advancements in the industry.<br><br>
