# BehaviouralQuestions

1. Tell me about yourself?<br>
In my most recent role I worked as a data analyst with Clarity Insights. I have a background of 4 years in the field of data analytics. I have worked at different stages of the data science pipeline during my career where I identified trends in data, derived insights and turned those into meaningful solutions for business use cases. I pursued my Master’s in Computer Science at Wright State University in Ohio and graduated in Dec 2018. At Clarity Insights, my role was providing Data & Analytics expertise that resulted in real and measurable business outcomes. I was involved in analyzing business and data requirements, create machine learning models designed to answer our client’s biggest data challenges and work with cross functional teams to ensure application quality and scalability.<br>
MunichRe is solving problems that have a real world large scale impact.  As we know data is key component in solving these problems, I can leverage my skills and background in data analytics to help the team at MunichRe develop reinsurance solutions that are both sustainable and needs-based. I will get an opportunity to do meaningful work that can have a positive impact on people's lives and that will be incredibly satisfying for me.<br><br>


2. Why are you leaving your current company / why did you leave your last job?<br>
I left Clarity Insights to move to Canada. My Wife and I had both applied for PR for canada and our applications were accepted. My wife got a job in Canada and so we decided to move here. Therefore, I left my last job.<br><br>

3. What internal factors would drive you to leave a good job? <br>
One of the reasons would be a micro-managing boss. Not that I have ever come accross such a situation, in all my previous roles I have felt empowered to make decisions, propose new ideas, received constructive feedback so that I can improve and encourage to learn new skills and keep upto date with latest technology advancements in the industry.<br><br>

4. If you could choose a person to work with, whom would you choose?<br>
I would always like to be in environments that have talented people and are experts in what they do. I believe in a continually learning process and there is a lot to learn from colleagues who are experts in their respective domains.<br><br>

5. Describe the work environment in which you will most effectively be able to contribute.
My ideal work environment is one that focuses on teamwork. I like companies like yours that put an effort in getting the group together and making sure everyone is supported. I work best in an environment which has challenging projects and opportunities to learn, and where people are empowered to share their ideas, opinions and viewpoints. <br><br>

6. Tell me about the last conflict you had with someone at work; how did you resolve it?<br>
I was working as a data analyst on an IT project in a cross functional team, and one team member was constantly late finishing tasks. As his input was crucial to my tasks I approached him about it and he reacted defensively. I kept calm and acknowledged that the deadlines were challenging and asked how I could assist him in improving his performance. He calmed down and told me that he was involved in another project where he had to do tasks that were not in his job description. After a meeting with other project manager, we came to a resolution that alleviated the technician’s workload. For the remainder of the project, that team member delivered great work.<br><br>

7. How would your current boss describe your work and contribution<br>
Actually, in my most recent performance review my direct supervisor described me as someone who takes initiative and doesn’t shy away from challenges. He said I make a great team and I am good at implementing plans.<br><br>

8. Other than your family, what are you passionate about?<br>
I am passionate about cooking. Cooking is love made edible… <br>
When I was a little kid, I used to help my mother in the kitchen. She would always make my favourite dishes. Watching her cook since I was a kid, made me want to try out. It is a great experience that makes you as well as others happy. Nowadays I am working on a red thai curry recipe to get the perfect balance of spicy, salty, sour and sweet.<br><br>

9. If you could be a superhero, what would you want your superpowers to be? <br>
The ability to absorb memories, knowledge, talent, and ability from others through interaction, understanding, and empathy.
At the core of this ability is the ability to learn and supernatural part would be how fast I would be able to learn. So Learning is how we become the greatest version of ourselves. It would allow me to ignite positive change in the world and leave a positive impact on our society. <br><br>

10. Tell me about a time that you failed?<br>
When I first started my career at Mu Sigma as a data analyst, I would find myself falling behind on work due to procrastination. This affected my work, as I was not meeting the standards, and making things harder for my team overall. After speaking with my manager, I realized that my procrastination was a symptom of lack of confidence in my abilities in my role. Upon discovering this, my manager and I decided it would be best if I shadowed other team members to watch how they work and ask questions for a month. I went on to successfully work for that company for almost 16mths and in all my roles since then at various companies, I no longer procrastinate, and regularly review training materials, ask relevant questions and adapt quickly to remain current about my job functions.<br><br>

11. What was a job project that you feel proud of?<br>
I have worked on many important projects throughout my career. What’s really crucial for me when starting a project is to get very clear on the goals right at the start and then create a plan with milestones. I also like dealing with the most difficult parts of the projects early on so that way if there are any significant issues, I still have time to handle them before the deadline. I also typically break down large tasks into smaller chunks, so that it is easier to know where to start. Detailed planning is very important to ensure an important project goes smoothly. For example, in my role as data scientist intern at Wellio I had to develop an Image Classification pipeline for classifying food recipe images as appealing or not, thus, preventing customer rejection of a recipe due to appearance. At this role the learning curve was very steep as the tech stack being used for the project was Python, Jupyter, Keras, sklearn and tools like Jupyter Notebooks were new, and I had not worked with libraries like scikit-learn, keras in a work environment. As the duration of the internship was 3 mths, my manager & I decided that I should spend a month to get training and familiarity with the tools being used in the project. Also in this Internship, I had to work on the project individually and my only point of contact was my manager. Due to my ability to adapt to new environments and gain new skills easily I was able to complete the project successfully and since it was my first job and first project I implemented successfully in the US I feel most proud about this project.<br><br>

12. How do you manage your time in a project when the project has a tight deadline?<br>
I typically aim to tackle the more difficult parts of a project early on because if you wait until the end of a day to tackle the tough parts, you stand the chance of running out of time. I also like to break down larger parts of a project into small chunks—doing so allows me to keep cool and not get overwhelmed while working up against the deadline. Also I like to make small milestones and deadlines for them and keep updating the team when they are achieved. Even if my tasks seemed unachievable, I would buckle down and figure out the best approach to completing the tasks. I would start by organizing the tasks from most important to least, and then I would begin working on the most important task. If there were any tasks I could delegate to other capable individuals, I would not be afraid to ask for assistance.<br><br>

13. What do you consider to have been your biggest failure; why do you consider it as such (what impact it had), and what did you learn from it? <br>
My greatest failure so far was sticking with my master's degree in Telecommunication past the point when I knew I wasn't interested in it. I graduated from the program but midway I just didn't feel good about it. I had trouble getting a job but I got it eventually because I pursued online courses in computer science and I learnt python programming. This helped me find out my passion and I ended up going back to school to pursue my masters in Computer Science. That delayed the start of my career by two years but I supported myself the whole time and now I love my career path, so the story has a happy ending.<br><br>

14. Tell me about a manager or someone of a senior nature you have worked well with and why? How did they manage or work with you?<br>
I’ve typically been given a lot of freedom to make decisions and self-manage in my career, which I love. However, in my last job, my boss resigned and a new supervisor came in who had a much more hands-on management style. I was still able to work well under this style of management and ended up getting along great with this new boss.

15. If you could do anything you wanted to do and you were financially secure, what would you do?<br>
I would buy a private island in Tahiti and spend rest of my life sipping pina colada's with my wife.<br><br>

16. What books are you currently reading/what websites do you like to visit?<br>
I am reading Rich Dad Poor Dad and its quite good, in the sense that it teaches you to see everything you buy from an asset / liability point of view. <br><br>

17. Describe a situation in which you aspired to reach a goal. What obstacles did you confront along the way? What did you do to overcome them?<br>
When I first started out in the industry, I did not have a lot of technical knowledge. I thought I would pick it up along the way, but after a month of working at my first job I realized I needed to make some changes if I wanted to be able to progress in my career. That is when I decided to be proactive in continually improving my technical skills. I started pursuing online courses and kept upto date with the latest skills needed to progress in my career. The positive effects started showing in my performance reviews where my managers started appreciating my ideas, work ethics and considered me an integral part of the team. <br><br>

18. What are the biggest ways people waste time on the job? What do you think are the reasons for this?<br>
I think some of the common reasons would be Cell Phone/Texting, Gossip, The Internet, Social Media and Snack Or Smoke Breaks. I think this is a human tendency and it’s nearly impossible for the team to be productive all of the time but steps can be taken to boost productivity levels in the workplace <br><br>

19. Where do you see yourself in 5 years time?<br>
Well I’m really excited by this position at Munich Re because in five years, I’d like to be seen as someone with deep expertise in the data science industry, and I know that’s something that I’ll have an opportunity to do here. I’m also really excited to take on more managerial responsibilities in the next few years and potentially even take the lead on some projects. I’ve been lucky enough to work with some amazing managers, and so developing into a great manager myself is something I’m really excited about.<br><br>

20. Could you tell me about a time you lacked the knowledge or skill to complete a task? <br>
in my role as data scientist intern at Wellio I had to develop an Image Classification pipeline for classifying food recipe images as appealing or not, thus, preventing customer rejection of a recipe due to appearance. At this role the learning curve was very steep as the tech stack being used for the project was Python, Jupyter, Keras, sklearn and tools like Jupyter Notebooks were new, and I had not worked with libraries like scikit-learn, keras in a work environment. As the duration of the internship was 3 mths, my manager & I decided that I should spend a month to get training and familiarity with the tools being used in the project. Also in this Internship, I had to work on the project individually and my only point of contact was my manager. Due to my ability to adapt to new environments and gain new skills easily I was able to complete the project successfully. <br><br>
